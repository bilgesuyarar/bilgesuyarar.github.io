  <h1>Sudoku Matrix – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 8, 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Sudoku Matrix (“Application”, “App”) handles user data.
    The App is developed and published by Bilgesu Yarar (“Developer”).
  </p>
  <p>By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Sudoku Matrix is designed to respect your privacy. The App does not collect or process any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
  <p>The only data stored is non-personal gameplay information saved locally on your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Puzzle progress</li>
    <li>Notes, mistakes, timer, difficulty</li>
    <li>User preferences (sound, vibration, theme, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is stored using SharedPreferences and never leaves your device.
    The developer does not have access to this data.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain non-personal identifiers such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID</li>
    <li>Device information (non-personal)</li>
    <li>Approximate location (for ad relevance)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    AdMob processes data under Google’s Privacy Policy:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      https://policies.google.com/privacy
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>No other third-party analytics, tracking, or SDKs are used.</p>

  <h2>3. How Your Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>The App uses data only for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Saving your game progress</li>
    <li>Enabling local game features (notes, mistakes, settings, etc.)</li>
    <li>Enabling ads to function properly</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The App does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect personal data</li>
    <li>Create user profiles</li>
    <li>Track you across apps or websites</li>
    <li>Sell or share any user information</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
  <p>All gameplay data is stored only on your device. No data is transmitted to external servers.</p>
  <p>You can delete all stored data at any time by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deleting the App, or</li>
    <li>Clearing the App’s storage from device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Sudoku Matrix is designed for a general audience and does not collect any personal information.
    Because no personal data is collected, the App is suitable for younger users as well.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Although the App does not process sensitive information, all locally stored data is protected by your device’s
    built-in security mechanisms (Android/iOS sandboxing).
  </p>
  <p>No data is transmitted online.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. Updates will be posted on the App Store and Google Play listing pages.
  </p>
  <p>Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
